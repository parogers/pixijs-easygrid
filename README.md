# pixijs-easygrid

A "good enough" grid sprite for PixiJS. This library supports basic grid rendering and also dual-grid.

## Demos

Have a look at these [online demos](https://parogers.github.io/pixijs-easygrid-examples/index.html), and take a peek at the [source code](https://github.com/parogers/pixijs-easygrid/tree/main/examples).

## Dual-grid rendering

This is based on the [work](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-unity) by Jess Hammer. That's also where I got the TilesDemo.png sample file.
